I am an historical phonologist specialising in Sino-Tibetan and Tai languages involved in documentation and description as well as typology, working to reconstruct the history of migration and social contact of the communities of the India-China-Myanmar border region.

I have been working with communities in the region since 2015 in order to help preserve and revitalise under-documented languages, especially regarding issues of language rights and representation. This involves engaging speakers and community linguists through training workshops as well as a number of regional open-access conferences and journals in an effort to increase representation of speech communities by their members.

### Current work

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Comparative Language Science](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zürich, as well as an adjunct in the [Department of Languages and Cultures](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/languages-and-cultures) at La Trobe University where I advise graduate students working in Northeast India and Myanmar.

My research involves applying novel tools and methods such as modern GIS data combined with historical maps, as well as applications of Bayesian inference on linguistic data in order to reconstruct subgroupings and the history of migration and language change in the regions. I am also involved in ongoing documentation of minority Sinitic varieties, a task which I have been involved in since 2009.

I am also the Associate Academic Director for the _Center for [Cultural-Linguistic Diversity – Eastern Himalaya](http://ccld-eh.org)_ (CCLD-EH) and
_Training and Resources for Indigenous Community Linguists_ (TRICL) program.

### Past work

My doctoral dissertation was on [_The tone system of Tangsa-Nocte and related northern Naga varieties_](http://arrow.latrobe.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/latrobe:43159) at La Trobe, and my master's thesis, _A Preliminary Description of the Historical Development of Modern Northern Wú Dialects_ 現代呉語太湖片發展的初步分析, was completed at the [Institute of Linguistics at National Tsing Hua University](http://www.ling.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php) 國立清華大學.

I also developed and currently manage [Phonemica](http://phonemica.net) 乡音苑, a crowd-sourced platform for oral history preservation and documentation of minority language varieties in and around China. Through Phonemica I work on [a number of other projects](https://github.com/phonemica) including mobile phone dictionaries and data-management software intended for use by community linguists working on under-documented languages.
